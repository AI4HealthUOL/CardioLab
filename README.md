## This is the official repository for **KardioLab**. A machine and deep learning framework for the estimation and monitoring of laboratory values throught ECG data.

KardioLab have been proposed in two main manuscrips:

1. **KardioLab: Laboratory Values Estimation from Electrocardiogram Features - An Exploratory Study.** <ins>Accepted by the international conference of computing in cardiology (CinC) 2024.</ins> [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1234.56789-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15871)
   
2. **KardioLab: Laboratory Values Estimation and Monitoring from Electrocardiogram Signals - A Deep-Multimodal Approach** [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1234.56789-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15871)




## Clinical Setting

![alt text](https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/KardioLab/blob/main/reports/abstract-1.png?style=centerme)

In this study, conducted within the context of an emergency department, we introduce a state-of-the-art biomedical multimodal benchmark. This benchmark is evaluated in two comprehensive settings:

1. **Patient Discharge Diagnoses**: A dataset consisting of 1,428 patient discharge diagnoses.
2. **Patient Decompensation Events**: A dataset consisting of 15 patient decompensation events.

The datasets include various patient data collected within a 90-minute interval upon arrival, such as:
- Demographics
- Biometrics

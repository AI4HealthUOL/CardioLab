## Clinical Setting

In this study, conducted within the context of an emergency department, we introduce a state-of-the-art biomedical multimodal benchmark. This benchmark is evaluated in two comprehensive settings:

1. **Patient Discharge Diagnoses**: A dataset consisting of 1,428 patient discharge diagnoses.
2. **Patient Decompensation Events**: A dataset consisting of 15 patient decompensation events.

The datasets include various patient data collected within a 90-minute interval upon arrival, such as:
- Demographics
- Biometrics
